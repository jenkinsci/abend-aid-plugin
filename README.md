The Plugin will need:
 A Configuration that will connect to a CES instant that will have a host connection to an Abend-AID Viewer(https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Mainframe/DevX/BMC-AMI-Common-Enterprise-Services/baces2601/Administering/Defining-host-connections/).
 

A Personal Access Token to request the API from CES(https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Mainframe/DevX/BMC-AMI-Common-Enterprise-Services/baces2601/Administering/Defining-security-settings/.


The following APIs are configured for the Jenkins Plugin.

When the Plugin is processed the JSON output will be placed in a formatted JSON file. This file will be in the workspace/buildname/Abend_AID_API.

If the Abend_AID_API folder does not exist it will create the folder.

Each JSON API file will be named after the build name from the Environment variables (BUILD_ID).

The format of the file name will be:

 APIBUILD_ID.txt
 
This will allow other Jenkins build steps or Pipelines to use the JSON data.



WARNING:
The file will be persistent and will not be deleted when it is used. When the process is done with the build it will need to be deleted if the file is not needed after the pipeline process.
